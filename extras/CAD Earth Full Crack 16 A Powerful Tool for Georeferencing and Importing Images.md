If you are looking for a software that can help you import and export images, objects and terrain meshes between Google Earth and AutoCAD, then you might want to check out CAD-Earth. CAD-Earth is a program that is designed to make your CAD work easier and more efficient. Here are some of the features and benefits of using CAD-Earth:
 
- Insert geoimages. You can select different service providers (Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ovi), image resolution (normal, medium, high, highest) and image mode (satellite, map, hybrid). Images can be imported to CAD programs in full color or grayscale in major image formats (BMP, JPEG, TIFF) and can be clipped inside a closed polyline. A world text file containing spatial data information can be created to georeference imported images[^1^] [^2^].
- Export CAD objects to Google Earth. Lines, polylines, arc, circles, points can be exported to Google Earth as polygons, routes or placemarks. Object line thickness, outline, fill color and opacity can be adjusted. Curve smoothness can be controlled specifying the maximum segment length and deflection angle. Placemark name, description, scale and icon can also be set[^1^] [^2^].
- Get contour lines, profiles and sections from Google Earth (Plus version). A terrain configuration mesh can be created inside an existing closed polyline or along a polyline path calculating point elevations from Google Earth. By specifying the origin point, rotation angle and distance between rows and columns the mesh density and precision can be adjusted. The resulting mesh can be used to obtain contour lines, dynamic profiles and section drawings complete with annotations[^1^] [^2^].
- Easy to use commands. You can pick CAD-Earth commands from a toolbar, from the screen menu or at the command prompt. Automatic command loading in each CAD session and extensive help in each step[^1^] [^2^].
- Persistent dialog box settings. Once you set options for a dialog box, they are automatically saved. Therefore, you don't have to set them each time you use a CAD-Earth command[^1^] [^2^].
- Dynamic object updating. When you modify object settings the corresponding contour lines, profiles or sections are dynamically updated[^1^] [^2^].
- Free direct technical assistance by the programmers. You can request new features and technical support directly from the programmers on the CAD-Earth menu. Remote technical support via TeamViewer is available on request with no extra charge[^1^] [^2^].

CAD-Earth is compatible with AutoCAD 2010-2022, BricsCAD v15-19, ZWCAD 2014-2018[^2^] [^3^]. It requires Windows 10 / Windows 8.1 /Windows 7 operating system and 4GB RAM (8GB or more recommended)[^2^]. You can download a free trial version of CAD-Earth from its official website or purchase a full license for $149[^3^] [^4^].
